 <p>"No one ever thought in Travnik that this town</p>
<p> was created for ordinary life and everyday events ...</p>
<p> Their city, in fact, is a narrow and deep fissure</p>
<p> that generations have built and cultivated over time,</p>
<p> a fortified passage where people have stayed to live constantly, </p>
<p>adapting himself and him to him through the centuries. " </p>
<p>Travnik Chronicle, Ivo Andric.</p>
